# 42. Agile - Retrospective meeting

Date: 2017-07-31

## Status

Accepted

## Context

1. Team members know little about last iteration and don’t know which part is good, bad or need improve;
2. New team members know nothing about the team’s history and don’t know the best practices for this team.

## Decision

### Description

After each iteration we'll spend one hour discussing relevant topics we add during the iteration in our retrospective board.

The idea is to spend quality time and get the most value out of this meeting, therefore each team member is encouraged to bring discussion topics as well as suggestion for improvement.

### Preparation

* The SM marks the current iteration as finished, moving all the unfinished tasks to the new iteration;
* Check the dashboard and analyze our metrics for the last finished iteration. Find out all problematic tasks with `low Flow Efficiency` or `low Quality Score`;
* The SM remind team members in team channel at least 10 minutes before starting the meeting;
	* Everyone is available;
	* Everyone is encouraged to prepared the `Good`,`Bad` and `Need improve` cards;
		* Something that went well or wrong;
		* Any type of improvement suggestion you might think of. Regarding the process, the code base, the collaboration etc.
	* Add description/comments to existing ones;
	* Votes(optional);

### Process

* Starts on time and all the team members must participate;
* Discuss problematic tasks that have bad metrics, in order to understand how we can improve;
	* Identify the root cause of the problem;
	* Come up with ideas about how we could have done it better, so that we can learn from our mistakes;
* The SM prioritizes the topics, based on team member's votes(optional);
* Each topic is time-boxed. However after the 5min timer expires, if everyone agrees we need further discussion, we restart the timer one more time.
* Follow up on the previous iteration's discussion;
* Follow up on existing action items;
* Discuss the accumulated cards in our Backlog, 5 minutes/card - with possibility to extend, if everyone agrees;
* Anybody can stop the current discussion if it's clear we're going nowhere;
* During the meeting the SM records the outcomes and action items in our retrospective board;
* At the end of the meeting we should save 10 min for a brief overview of the past iteration(s) (recently completed features, features in progress, planed features, velocity graphs and user story vs bugs graphs)
* We keep the retrospective meetings within 1 hour.

## Consequences

Everyone will learn from history, and not make same error twice.
