Date: 2017-06-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

effective
purpose, comunication, sharing planning today, what done yesterday.
1. Purpose
2. Howto
3. Stand up
4. Board(stand around)
5. One minute per person
6. 

## Decision

Effective standups are all about communication and commitment, not about status updates.

* Less than 15 minutes;
* Everyone should standup;
* Safe time - make sure everyone free that time;
* Focus - Every should watching the board;
We're on the same page about what everyone in the team is working on and we can strategize on how to approach the work items on the board for the day to come.

# Meeting

So before every scrum take 5 minutes to actually think and note down what you were planning to accomplish yesterday, did you actually accomplish what you've committed to, if not why?

Take some time to plan your day and decide what you're going to accomplish today, commit to it and state it to the team (not the management), so the team members will keep each other accountable for the commitments they make to make the whole team improve together and make sure to remove impediments that prevent team members to accomplish what they plan.

Scrum master should pay more attention to the status of each card, encourage team members to deploy in time.
